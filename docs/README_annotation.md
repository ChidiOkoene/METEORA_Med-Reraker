Rationale Annotation Guidelines (for clinicians / annotators)

Objective:
- For each clinical query, produce up to 3 concise rationales (1–2 sentences) describing the specific evidence a passage should contain to support the correct answer.

Style:
- Use precise clinical language (e.g., 'elevated troponin T', 'focal lobar consolidation on CXR').
- Avoid hedging unless appropriate.
- Each rationale: aim 8–30 words.

Content:
- Cover different evidence types when relevant (symptoms, labs, imaging, risk factors).
- Rationale 1: most diagnostic cue.
- Rationale 2: supporting evidence.
- Rationale 3: optional detail or confounder.

PHI & privacy:
- Do not include patient identifiers. De-identify notes before annotation.

Quality control:
- Perform spot checks and adjudication for inter-annotator disagreements.

If unsure:
- Use the annotator notes field to explain ambiguity.
